# Perlin Noise Visualization

## Introduction
This project is a web-based visualization of Perlin noise, inspired by the techniques demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY). Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise often used in computer graphics and procedural generation. Our implementation enhances the visualization by introducing a fullscreen mode and making it fully responsive to accommodate various devices and screen sizes.

## Features
- **Perlin Noise Visualization**: Generates a smooth, natural-looking visual representation of Perlin noise.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Allows users to toggle into a fullscreen experience for an immersive view.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the visualization is beautifully rendered on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
